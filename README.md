### Hi there 👋

I'm **Ali** living in **Tehran, Iran** which is absent from most country lists you find on web. <br>
I'm also a **dad** and a full-stack design driven developer (🖌 🚙 🖥). <br>
Aside from **HTML** and **CSS** dialects I mostly speak **JavaScript** and **PHP** with computers and sometimes other humans. <br>
For the past 20 years, I've been learning how people make computers to turn the electricity ⚡️ to cool actions and things.

👨🏻‍💻 I’m currently working on an online coaching platform, using [AdonisJS](https://github.com/adonisjs) and [Nuxt.js](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js)
